    <div class="blog-content">

        <p>
            During Q2 2022, I signed up for a 3-day surfing training course in the heart of the Arabian Sea, Mulki. It was the Day 3, I had just finished dinner at the surf camp.
        </p>

        <p>
            I had come solo, didn't know anyone at first, but by now there were familiar faces. 3 days of 4-hour daily surf training had ended. We were tired. The good kind of tired. Skin burnt, bodies sore, but hearts full. That night, after dinner, a few of us were sitting quietly. Just talking about how fast it all went by.
        </p>

        <p>
            Suddenly a girl came running towards our dining hut and said
        </p>

        <p>
            <span class="highlight">"Guys… the backwaters are glowing."</span>
        </p>

        <p>
            We stared at her and laughed while asking "Glowing? As in… actual light?"
        </p>

        <p>
            She didn't laugh. Just said, "Come and see."
        </p>

        <p>
            I don't know why, but something felt off already.
        </p>

        <p>
            I remember a cat nearby screaming. Not meowing, screaming.
        </p>

        <p>
            And the insects around the trees were louder than usual, like someone turned up their volume.
        </p>

        <p>
            We laughed it off, but I was a curious and a bit nervous at the same time.
        </p>

        <p>
            Still, I followed him and went there to check.
        </p>

        <p>
            I was gonna take my phone as a natural habit, but kayaking usually means water, splashes, getting wet and I didn't want to risk it. So I left it behind in the room.
        </p>

        <p>
            We crossed a narrow patch lined with coconut trees and reached an old temple. Just behind it was the entry to the backwaters, where we could begin kayaking into the dark.
        </p>

        <p>
            It felt like no one had stepped there in years.
        </p>

        <p>
            The backwaters were right in front of us. Pitch black, still, no sound.
        </p>

        <p>
            Me along with two more surfers pulled out a few kayaks from the side.
        </p>

        <p>
            I didn't know what was coming.
        </p>

        <p>
            We stepped into the kayaks and slowly pushed off.
        </p>

        <p>
            The moment I dipped my paddle in the backwaters, the water lit up.<br> Yes! That girl was right. The water was actually glowing up. A visible neon blue colour.
        </p>

        <p>
            It looked like stars underwater.<br>
            Neon Blue sparkles trailing wherever I moved.
        </p>

        <p>
            I'd never seen anything like it.
        </p>

        <p>
            It's called <a href="https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=282e00537676e852&rlz=1C1RXQR_enIN1007IN1008&sxsrf=AE3TifPA2-fqiRPMwhRwhXmI645UkWX9kA:1750041731425&q=bioluminescence&udm=2&fbs=AIIjpHxU7SXXniUZfeShr2fp4giZ1Y6MJ25_tmWITc7uy4KIeiAkWG4OlBE2zyCTMjPbGmMU8EWskMk2JSE__efdUJ3xRFvZ0M2vJLB0hUMk5HOE2OjlycQYRp9vQECfaBtuI77VBixuZT8Ikq7knPIraxtLcXUn-925YP4AZPohtCshEMzz_HYh-s2jy_GenEFZtSggFj5UruF1QvDnKbUPJW54S8V0hw&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi9nvm99fSNAxXVVWwGHQElOqcQtKgLegQIERAB" target="_blank" style="color:#0066cc; text-decoration:underline;">bioluminescence</a>, I found out later.<br>Tiny creatures in the water that glow when disturbed.<br>It's a rare phenomenon observed in coastal areas.
        </p>

        <p>
            But at that moment, I wasn't thinking about science.
        </p>

        <p>
            I was just… quiet.
        </p>

        <p>
            Half amazed.
        </p>

        <p>
            Half scared.
        </p>

        <p>
            Then came the thuds.<br>Fishes hitting the bottom of my kayak.<br>Again. And again.<br>Harder than you'd expect.
        </p>

        <p>
            There was something terrifying about that sound.<br>As if the river didn't want us there.
        </p>

        <p>
            And I won't lie. I was actually scared.
        </p>

        <p>
            I had this feeling that I wasn't supposed to be there.<br>Not in a "haunted" way… just this weird tension.<br>Like the river was watching.
        </p>

        <p>
            The glowing continued.
        </p>

        <p>
            The fish didn't stop.
        </p>

        <p>
            I kept paddling. Quiet. Still trying to act okay.
        </p>

        <p>
            At one point, I looked around, stars above, glowing water below, and that silence all around.
        </p>

        <p>
            I felt tiny.
        </p>

        <p>
            I felt human.
        </p>

        <p>
            And I felt like the river was letting me in, but also warning me not to go too far.
        </p>

        <p>
            There were no photos. No videos.
        </p>

        <p>
            We were in the backwaters for a couple of hours and went straight back to our surf camp.
        </p>

        <p>
            I didn't sleep well that night.
        </p>

        <p>
            Not because I was scared. Just something about the whole thing stayed with me. Even now, I don't fully understand it.
        </p>

        <p>
            Or maybe I don't need to.
        </p>

        <p>
            Some things are better left unexplained.
        </p>

        <p>
            Sometimes the world shows you something that's both beautiful and a little haunting. Just enough to remind you that you're not in control. That there are still places, even in this over-photographed world, where the mystery is untouched.
        </p>

        <p>
            That night taught me something simple:
        </p>

        <p>
            <span class="highlight">You don't always need answers. Some experiences are meant to leave you wondering.</span>
        </p>

        <p>
            <span class="highlight">No one at the surf camp believed us when we told them. Maybe you won't believe either. And maybe that's exactly how it should be.</span>
        </p>
